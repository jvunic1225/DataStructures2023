1. The toString() method is inherited from the Object class, which is the root of the Java class hierarchy.

2. An abstract method is a method that is declared but not implemented in the current class. 
We use abstract methods to ensure that subclasses of an abstract class implement specific behavior, 
allowing for different uses of that behavior

3. A Java interface is a collection of abstract methods and constants that can be implemented by any class
 A Java class is for creating objects that contain state and behavior
 
4. No, an interface cannot be instantiated. 
 An interface only defines behavior and does not have any implementation of its own
 
5. The array for animals can house Fish because fish implements the animal interface, guardDog can be
 housed because it extends dog which implements the animal interface
 
6. The concrete class implementing an interface must provide implementation of all methods from the interface

7. If fish does not define a method from the Animal interface, it must be an abstract class
 
8. Two attributes in guardDog that differ from its parent class are meanness and fur color
 
9. The attribute in showDog that differs from its parent class is breed
 
10.All methods of an interface are public and abstract
